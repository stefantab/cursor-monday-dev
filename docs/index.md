# Cursor + monday dev — Run your sprint from your IDE

Use AI‑assisted commands in Cursor to update monday items, add concise status summaries from recent commits/PR diffs, and link work without leaving your editor.

- Install extension: #
- Read docs: https://github.com/stefantab/cursor-monday-dev#readme

## Highlights
- Command palette actions to update items and statuses
- AI‑generated status summaries (human‑in‑the‑loop approval)
- Suggest relevant monday items based on branch/commits
- Link PRs and push updates without context switching

## Quick start
1. Install the Cursor extension (coming soon).
2. Connect your monday account.
3. Pick workspace and board.
4. Use “Add AI summary” on your current branch to post a status update.

## Security & privacy
- Local context by default; explicit consent before sending summaries
- OAuth to monday; secure token storage in IDE
- Minimal telemetry focused on feature usage (configurable)
